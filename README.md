# sohan-shop-front-end
This project is the front end of a Sohan (a Persian traditional confection)shop website.This was designed using HTML &amp; CSS. This is just a simple example of usage of HTML &amp; CSS for beginners and I worked on this when I fisrt started learning front-end development. I used CSS Flexbox layout and also made sure that it works as a responsive web page. As I mentioned, this is a Persian website so I used Farsi fonts to make it look better.
